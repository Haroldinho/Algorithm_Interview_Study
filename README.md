I made this folder to keep track of what I have implemented in my pursuit of mastering data structures and algorithms
There are two main subfolders in this directory.

Algorithms_in_cpp:
 Contains the tracked assignments I have used while going through the Algorithms specialization sequence offered by Prof. Tim Roughgarden on Coursera.
See https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms for details
The specialization is subdivided into four courses:
- Course 1: Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms
- Course 2: Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures
- Course 3: Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming
- Course 4: Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What to do about them

All the assignments have been implemented in C++.
In addition, most of the assignments have been tested against a battery of unit tests found online for this class using the Catch2 framework.
I highly recommend anyone serious about learning the material to always test her or his code against simple examples and edge cases.

The test cases were obtained from the followeing directory: https://github.com/beaunus/stanford-algs/.

Note to self: Add a bash or perl command to load the test files automatically to a new machine, without having to save the test suite in my own git repo.

Data Structures: 
	Contains few of the LeetCode and HackerRank exercises, I have used in my preparation to coding interviews. 
Most of the code included is related to problems I personally found difficult to implement.
I have therefore tested them on my local machines to enrich my experience, and save my solution.
All the code in this folder has been implemented in Python.
